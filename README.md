# ResultsSummaryComponentPage

This is a solution to the [Results summary component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/results-summary-component-CE_K6s0maV). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

This is a component results summary  page, about a test of reactions, memory, etc. You can view it using a desktop or a phone, I've tried to provide the right responsiveness.

I developed trying to improve my skills in CSS and HTML and get more confident to try projects that are more complex.

This project was developed using flexbox to get the layout that I wanted, I don't know if the way that I used, spliting some elements in divs, is the best way to develop this, but it worked well as far as I can think. If you have any suggestions, I would love to hear and learn.
